Writing the report 
• Title page: It should include the module code and name (MANG6517 Marketing in the Digital Age for Accounting and Management), assignment title (Digital Marketing assignment for Catalyse Life Drinks), your student ID number and the word count (The word limit is 3000 +/- 10%).
• Structure your assignment: It is essential to have a strong and coherent structure. Use numbered headings to break your report into discrete sections. Adding subtitles (if appropriate) will make the report more structured and easier to read and comprehend.
• Avoid lengthy descriptions and lengthy paragraphs. Show that you can apply the digital marketing theories and concepts you have learnt.
• The word count covers everything in the file (as per the word count function in the software package), including the title page but excluding the reference list and appendices.
• All tables and figures should be labelled and numbered. The source(s) of the table/figure needs to be cited.
• Follow Harvard Referencing System. The reference list (i.e. NOT a bibliography of everything that you have read) should be sorted alphabetically by first author’s surname: do not separate out different types of sources (books, journals, etc) into different lists. Do not number the list.
• Use an appropriate writing style. This means avoiding informalities like “haven’t”, “can’t” and “isn’t”, and avoid slang unless you need to use it - in a quotation - to make a point. Do not use abbreviations such as “” for “and”. Avoid using the first person (I, we).
• The first time you use an acronym (e.g., NPD), put the acronym in parentheses after the full term (e.g., new product development (NPD)). Thereafter you can stick to using the acronym.
